# Digital Business Automation Reference Architecture

This project represents the body of knowledge around business automation architecture and can be considered as a live book, we are writing on a daily basis from the experience gathered with our consulting engagements.
All the content is visible [as a BOOK format here](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-dba).  

The content of this repository is the source of the digital business automation reference architecture in the [IBM Garage architecture center visible here](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/dba-architecture). This git repository is maintained on a weekly basis and includes more content not yet formally published to IBM sites. As we are implementing the end to end solution we are updating this main git repository to keep best practices accurate.
