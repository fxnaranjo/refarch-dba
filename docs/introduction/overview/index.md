## What is it about?

This repository provides working a set of patterns, best practices and reusable code and executable scenarios to help you build and deploy application using business automation capabilities from the IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation.

[Intelligent business automation](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/basics-of-business-automation) is driven by AI and means that machines can “learn” and make decisions based on situations they have encountered and analyzed. For example, in customer service, virtual assistants powered by AI can reduce costs while enabling smarter interactions between customers and human agents. The result is a better customer service experience. Whether you’re running a small business or a large enterprise, automation is an excellent way to streamline operations and drive business growth. To realize the full potential of automation, businesses need to consistently utilize proven automation software and best practices across all workflows — from creating faster, digital customer experiences to simplifying internal processes.

The [IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-business-automation) is an automation platform that provides AI-generated recommendations, analytics to measure impact and user-friendly low-code tooling to help organizations reduce the amount of time spent on manual processes and decrease customer wait times. With IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation, you can eliminate repetitive tasks and reallocate your resources toward higher-value work.

The following are key capabilities available in the platform:

In this repository we are developing new content for integrating cloud native applications, DevOps practices and business automation components.

## Architecture center

The reference architecture is described in the [IBM reference architecture center](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/dba-architecture) and the content reflects standard capabilities to consider for deploying solution.

The current web site includes other diagrams as reference physical deployments, use cases and demonstrations.

## Target Audiences

While the content of this repository is mostly technical in nature and is intended for a technical audience, it also introduces methodology practices, which would be used with business leaders to identify key business domain events and actions. You may find it useful to share this information with your business leaders before engaging them in such activities.
