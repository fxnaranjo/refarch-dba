## Introduction 

This repository includes working content on best practices and reusable content for deploying digital business application using IBM Cloud Pak for Automation products.

[Digital business automation (DBA)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-automation) allows an organization to improve its operations by streamlining the way people participate in business processes and workflows, automate repeatable decisions, and provide business users with the ability to edit and change the business logic involved in these business processes. DBA projects also aim to make documents easy to store and retrieve, digitize document content, such as with optical character recognition (OCR), and automate data entries with software robots, referred as robotic process automation.

The IBM Cloud Pak for Automation offers a software platform to develop, deploy, run and manage your digital business automation projects, using the capabilities shown in the following digram:

* [Automation Decision Services](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYHZ8_20.0.x/com.ibm.dba.aid/topics/con_aid_intro.html) provides a comprehensive environment for authoring, managing, and running decision services.
* Tasks with Robot Process Automation 
* [Business Automation Insight](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYHZ8_20.0.x/com.ibm.dba.bai/topics/con_bai_overview_top.html)
* [Business Automation Application](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYHZ8_20.0.x/com.ibm.dba.offerings/topics/con_baa.html) is a low-code application builder that you can use to create, modify, and refine business automation-based applications (apps) that use the capabilities of the platform.

In this repository we are developing new content for integrating cloud native application, DevOps practices and Business Automation components. 

## Architecture center

The reference architecture is described in the [IBM reference architecture center](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/dba-architecture) and the content reflects standard capabilities to consider for deploying solution.
