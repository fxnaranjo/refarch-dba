# Introduction

**Entry Point:** Enable secure, compliant content access with content services

**Use Case Overview:** Focus Corp must collaborate both internally and externally during the employee onboarding process as well as enforce structured and adhoc workflows. 

Focus Corp accelerates the use of unstructured content in an employee onboarding use case using teamspaces and secure external file sharing. You will assume the role of Lucy, an HR employee onboarding specialist at Focus Corp. Lucy’s objective is to improve Focus Corp’s process and ensure various onboarding requirements are met in a secure, structured, consistent and timely manner to onboard the new employees.

**Choose an option:**

  * **Digital Business Automation on Cloud trial:** your environment is predeployed, continue to the [Getting Started Lab](#getting-started-lab) section below.
  * **Install Yourself:** To deploy Onboarding Automation on your own environment, and technical architecture information, see the <a href="https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/dba-onboarding-automation" target="_blank">dba-onboarding-automation</a> git repository which includes the required deployment artifacts.

<br/>

**Use Case Overview**

<br/>

Employee applicant (John Doe) has submitted an employee application and interview video along with other materials as part of the employement application process.  During this process, HR processors have initially reviewed the employement application making comments and annotations on the document along with entering video bookmarks allowing additional reviewers to quickly locate key responses.  Lucy along with other reviewers are able to review all the information and documents pertaining to applicant John Doe in the **Teamspace** in a consistent and secure manner using an intuitive user-interface. Some of the information such as the applicant's SSN is available on some of the documents but they are redacted so that only reviewers with the approrprate permission are able to see the redacted content.  The use of video bookmarks also allows Lucy to quickly jump to key sections of the the video without necessarily having to watch the entire video.  Finally, we are able to integrate with **IBM Business Automation Workflow** to launch additional manual and automated processes.

<summary>3 - Tour IBM Navigator</summary>

#### IBM Navigator is a desktop for an organization's workers to find and organize information.

<br/>

You are now a Human Resources (HR) Onboarding specialist (Lucy) at Focus Corp reviewing an applicant (John Doe) for employment. As an onboarding specialist, Lucy will use the IBM Navigator user interface to review content submitted by John such as the employment application and interview video.

<br/>

Let's take a quick tour of the **IBM Navigator** user interface.

<br/>

1. As shown in the diagram below is the **IBM Navigator** user interface.  At the top of the interface, we see a configurable banner with a hamburger icon to access the navigation menu to access features such as **Browse**, **Search**, **Share**, **Teamspaces**, **Workflow** and **Records Management**.  Additional features can also be added using plugins.  Select the **Browse** feature.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/100-Navigator-Browse2.png)

<br/>

We are currently viewing a repository called **Corporate Operations** which is an **IBM FileNet Content Manager** repository. We can also access other repositories and perform cross-repository searches using **CM8** (IBM Content Manager), **CMOD** (IBM Content Manager OnDemand), **Box®** and **CMIS** (Content Management Interoperability Services) compliant repositories like **Alfresco® ** and **Microsoft SharePoint®** On-Premises.

<br/>

3. Select the **Focus Corp Docs / Human Resources / Onboarded Employees** folder representing content for already onboarded employees.
Next, select the **Selena Swift** folder as shown in the diagram below.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/110-Navigator-OnboardedEmployees.png)

<br/>


For onboarded employee – **Selena Swift**, we can see custom folder properties such as the **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Employee ID**, **Onboarding** status and **Hire Date**.

<br/>

4. Select the **Employee Packet** folder and then in the upper-right corner, select the different **Views** (**Details**, **Magazine**, **Filmstrip**).
Let's first select the **Details** view as shown in the diagram below.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/120-Navigator-Details.png)

<br/>

In our example, Focus Corp maintains an **Employee Packet** folder that contains new employee info documents such as the **Confidentially Agreement** and **Employee Manual**.  In the **Details** view, we are able to see the thumbnail and properties of the selected content.

<br/>

5. Select the **Magazine** view

<br/>

 ![13](./images/121-Navigator-Magazine.png)

<br/>

In the **Magazine** view, we can now we see the same content along with social features such as **Likes**, **Tags**, **Downloads** and **Comments**.

<br/>

6. Select the **Filmstrip** view.  The **Filmstrip** view is very useful for looking at media such pictures.  Select the **Photos** folder below the **Employee Packet** folder and then select each picture document.

<br/>

<summary>4 - Teamspaces</summary>


#### Let’s now look at Teamspaces.  Teamspaces represent a focused view of the relevant folders, documents and searches that a team needs to complete their tasks.

<br/>

Our use case scenario revolves around Lucy reviewing an existing teamspace for employee applicant John Doe.  Typicaly, the teamspace would have already been created, processed and reviewed by a few HR processors before reaching Lucy to further review and approve the applicant for onboarding.  In this section, we first create an employee onboarding teamspace for the employee applicant John Doe.  Next, we will review how a teamspace is used once it is created.

<br/>

<details>
<a name="lab-section-41"></a>
<summary style="margin-left: 40px">4.1 - Create Teamspace</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">

<br/>

An **Employee Onboarding** Teamspace Template should already be available.  If not or if you want to learn more about creating teamspace, please proceed to the next section below.  Otherwise, proceed to section **4.1.2 - Teamspace Builder**.

<br/>

</p>

<details>
<a name="lab-section-411"></a>
<summary style="margin-left: 80px">4.1.1 - Teamspace Template Builder</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 80px">

<br/>

This section covers the creation of a teamspace template using the **Teamspace Template Builder**.

<br/>

The use of **Teamspace Templates** allows for the configuration of the folder hierarchy, documents, search templates, and security in a user-friendly wizard interface which can then be used to create Teamspaces in a timely, secure and consistent manner.

<br/>

1. From the navigation menu, click on **Teamspaces**

 ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/100-Teamspace-Feature.png)

<br/>
<br/>

2. Click on the **Templates** tab and then click on **New Template**

 ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/110-New-Teamspace-Template.png)

<br/>

As shown in the diagram below, the **Teamspace Template Builder** is displayed.

<br/>

The teamspace template builder uses a wizard-driven user interface that guides you through the following steps:
- Define Teamspace Template
- Select Searches
- Select Classes or Entry Templates
- Folders and Documents Tree
- Select Roles

<br/>

 ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/120-Template-Builder.png)

<br/>
<br/>

3. Teamspace Template Builder - Step 1 - Define Teamspace Template

<br/>

Enter any value for the **Template name** and **Template description**.  If you are using a shared environment and plan to share the template, please select a value that distinguishes your template from others. In the diagram below, we entered a generic template name and description for our employee onboarding use case. For this template, we have specified not to share the template.

<br/>

At this point, we can continue to the next step by clicking on the **Next** button for the remaining configuration items (searches, classes/entry templates, folders/documents and roles).  At any point, we can complete the configuration of the template by clicking on the **Finish** button and optionally edit the configuration at a later time.

<br/>

When complete, click on the **Next** button to continue to the next step.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/130-Define-Teamspace-Template.png)

<br/>
<br/>

4. Teamspace Template Builder - Step 2 - Select Searches

<br/>

Specifying a search name will allow members of the teamspace to use a saved search to easily find documents relevant to the teamspace project.  To add a search, specify a **Search Name** in the bottom list and then click the **Add** button. In the diagram below and in our main demo scenario, we have elected not to use a saved search.  When complete, click on the **Next** buton to continue to the next step.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/140-Select-Searches.png)

<br/>
<br/>

5. Teamspace Template Builder - Step 3 - Select Classes or Entry Templates

<br/>

This steps specifies either document classes or entry templates that can be used to store documents into the teamspace.  Configure this step using the class or entry template based on your use case.  As shown in the diagram below for our main demo use case, first click the option for **Use entry templates to add documents**.  Select the **Employee Onboarding - Application** and the **Employee Onboarding - Document** entry templates.  Finally, click on the **Add** button and then the **Next** button to continue to the next step.

<br/>

Please note that the **Employee Onboarding - Application** entry template uses the **Employment Application** document class and the **Employee Onboarding - Document** entry template uses the default **Document** class.  If these entry templates are not available, either create them or simply select the other option of **Use classes to add documents** and specify the **Document** class and the **Employe Application** class.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/150-Select-Entry-Template.png)

<br/>
<br/>

6. Teamspace Template Builder - Step 4 - Folder and Documents Tree

<br/>

This step configures the folder structure that should be used for the teamspace.  Additionally, documents can be added to the folder(s).  The use of a common folder structure and default documents provide a consistent process so that any teamspaces created with this template uses a consistent and standardized folder hierarchy and documents.

<br/>

Click **New Folder** and then build the folder structure shown below or based on your demo scenario.  To add a document to a folder, click on the **Add Document** button and add a document.  When complete, click on the **Next** button to continue to the last step.

<br/>

As shown in the diagram below, we have built the folder structure for the Automation Onboarding demo use case.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/160-Folders-Documents-Tree.png)

<br/>
<br/>

7. Teamspace Template Builder - Step 5 - Select Roles

<br/>

This steps allows us to create any custom roles for the template which can also be shared with other templates.  Click on **New Role** and then specify the **Role name** and **Role description**.  Next, set the desired permissions on the role.  To share the role with other templates, click on **Make Available**.  Click on the **Finish** button to complete the setup of the teamspace template. The teamspace temlate can be updated at a later time if desired.

<br/>

The teamspace template is now complete, please refer to the next section **Teamspace Builder** to create a teamspace from this template.

<br/>

![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/220-Define-Teamspace.png)

<br/>

We can directly build the teamspace or we can specify the teamspace template that contains some pre-define configuration settings.  Using the template allows us to consistently build the teamspace ensuring the proper folder, documents, searches and roles are configured for every new project. At the same time, we are also able to slightly modify these settings as we create the teamspace for any additional configuration that may be needed for the specific teamspace.

<br/>

At this point, we can continue to the next step by clicking on the **Next** button for the remaining configuration items (searches, classes/entry templates, folders/documents and roles).  At any point, we can complete the configuration of the template by clicking on the **Finish** button and optionally edit the configuration at a later time.

<br/>

When complete, click on the **Next** button to continue to the next step.

<br/>

4. Teamspace Builder - Step 2 - Select Searches

<br/>

Any saved searches that were included in the teamspace template should be listed in the **Selected searches** area.  If desired, add any searches that you would like to be included in the teamspace.  When complete, click the **Next** button to continue to the next step.

<br/>

![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/230-Select-Searches.png)

<br/>

5. Teamspace Builder - Step 3 - Select Classes or Entry Templates

<br/>

This step identifies the classes or entry templates that were configured with the teamspace template.

<summary>5 - View and Edit Documents</summary>

<br/>

Continuing from the previous **Review Teamspace** section, let's now review how to view and edit documents.
> Note: Use the application document (**Focus Corp - Employment Application.pdf**) that was added to the Teamspace in section **2 - Login and Setup Your Environment - Setup Instructions - Add employment application document**.  This document represents the employee applicant's employment application and also contains an I9 document which will we split into a second document using the **Merge and Split** option.

1. From the **Teamspace**, click on the application document

 ![13](./images/300-Viewer-Overview.png)

<br/>

Review the different areas of the viewer including the various tools/icons as shown in the diagram below.  Hovering the mouse over each tool will displays a tool tip identifying the purpose of the tool.

<br/>
<br/>

2.  From view settings area of the screen, click on the **Fit to window** icon to fit a full page of the document in the display

 ![13](./images/310-Viewer-Fit.png)

<br/>

As displayed in the diagram above, the page should now fit in the display window.  We can now see the full page of the document including all the redactions and annotations on the first page.  Annotations allow you to mark up a document with items such as lines, rectangles, redactions, text, highlights, sticky notes, pencil and stamps.  Each annotation has security permissions and includes the user and timestamp the annotation was created/modified.

<br/>
<br/>

3. For each redaction and annotation, hover the mouse over the item to see who created the item and the creation timestamp.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/315-Viewer-Timestamp.png)

<br/>

4. Right-click on a redaction then select the first menu option which is **Select Redaction Reason**

<br/>

 ![13](./images/320-Viewer-Redaction-Reason.png)

<br/>

As displayed in the diagram above, the reason for the redaction is displayed and can also be set to a different reason if desired.  Redaction Reasons use role-based security so that only users within a configured role can see behind the redaction and/or manage the redaction. Additionally, data capture/processing solutions can be configured to automatically redact values such as a Social Security Number and associate with the redaction reason.

<br/>

Click **Cancel** to exit out of the **Select Redaction Reason** dialog window.

<br/>
<br/>

5. On the application document, either double-click on the yellow sticky note -OR- right-click on the sticky note and then click on the second menu option for **Edit text**

<br/>

 ![13](./images/330-Sticky-Note.png)

<br/>

As displayed in the diagram above, the text for the **Sticky note** annotation is displayed along with the creation/modified timestamp. With appropriate security, we are also able to modify the text.  The **Sticky note** in the annotation toolbar is also identified in the diagram if you want to create a new **Sticky note** annotation.

<br/>

To the right of the **Sticky note** annotation on the application document, there is also a **Text** annotation to display text without having to open the annotation.

<br/>
<br/>

6. In the upper-right corner of the viewer, click on the **View Comments** icon

<br/>

 ![13](./images/340-Doc-Comment.png)

<summary>6 - Merge and Split (OPTIONAL)</summary>

<br/>

Continuing from the previous section viewing the thumbnails of the application document - the first five pages represent the actual application document.  The next four pages is an **I9 - Employment Verification** document that does not belong with our document.  We'll use the **Merge and Split** feature to first create a copy of our document and then remove the first five pages to create a separate I9 document.  Next, we'll remove the last four pages of our employment application document so that it only contains the correct pages.

<br/>
<br/>

1. From the upper-right corner of the viewer, select the **Open in New Window** icon to open the viewer in a separate window which allows us to select the **Merge and Split** option.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/370-MergeSplit-Open.png)

<br/>
<br/>

2.  From the separate viewer window, select the **Merge and Split** icon at the top of the viewer.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/372-MergeSplit-Option.png)

<br/>

As displayed in the diagram below, we are now in the **Merge and Split** mode where we can see the three icons for **Cut**, **Copy** and **Paste**.  We are also able to move one or more pages by selecting the page(s) and dragging it to the desired location.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/373-MergeSplit-Main.png)

<br/>
<br/>

4.  Select the **Add document** icon from the top menu bar so that we can create the separate document

<br/>

 ![13](./images/374-MergeSplit-AddDoc.png)

<br/>

As displayed in the diagram below, the **Add Document** window appears.  Select the **Employee Onboarding - Document** entry template which uses the default **Document** class.  Next, set the **Document Title** property to **John Doe - I9** and finally click the **Add** button to add the document.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/375-MergeSplit-DocSave.png)

<br/>
<br/>

5.  There should now be two tabs in the document viewer with the second tab representing the newly added **John Doe - I9** document.  We want to remove the employee application pages - select the first five pages of the document and then click on the **Cut** icon to remove the selected pages.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/376-MergeSplit-I9.png)

<br/>
<br/>

6.  As shown in diagram below, there should be four document pages.  Click on the **Check in document** icon to save and check-in the document to the repository.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/377-1-MergeSplit-I9CheckIn.png)

<br/>
<br/>

7.  Click on the first document tab which is our original employment application document.  Next, select the last four pages of the document and then select the **Cut** icon to remove the I9 document pages.  Finally, click on the **Check in document** icon to save and check-in the document to the repository.

<br/>

<summary>7 - Video Viewer (OPTIONAL)</summary>

<br/>

1.  Let's now take a look at the video viewer to view and stream videos and audio files.  From the **Teamspace**, click on the video name in the folder: **Employee Onboarding \ Application \ Video Interview**.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/380-Video-Launch.png)

<br/>

Note that selecting the video will also provide a short live preview of the video in the right pane along with the properties of the video.

<br/>
<br/>

2. Click on the **Open in New Window** icon in the upper right corner of the viewer to open the viewer in a new window so we can access the video bookmark feature.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/382-Video-OpenNewWindow.png)

<br/>
<br/>

3. Click on **Bookmarks** on the top left area of the viewer

<br/>

 ![13](./images/383-Video-Bookmarks.png)

<br/>

Afer selecting **Bookmarks**, the list of video bookmarks will be displayed.  These were manually entered by an HR specialist during the initial application review process.  Each bookmark identifies the name of the bookmark, bookmark description, the time of the bookmark and the user who created the bookmark.  The use of video bookmarks is very valuable for Focus Corp to be able to quickly review key segments of the video without viewing the entire video.  Additionally, the video viewer enables you to view, collaborate and easily stream large video files without requiring any browser plugins.

<br/>

Entering text in the **Filter** field also allows you to search on the name of the bookmark allowing for even faster location of a particular bookmark in the event there are numerous bookmarks.  For example, enter **strengths** to quickly go to the bookmark named **What is your greatest strengths**

<br/>
<br/>

4. From the bookmark list, click on a bookmark and then cycle through the bookmarks by clicking on the **Previous** and/or **Next** buttons

<br/>

 ![13](./images/384-Video-PreviousNext.png)

<br/>

Notice that the video starts immediately as you click each bookmark with little or no lag.  When the video is initially opened, the video can be played right away as the video is streamed in the background when initially opened.

<br/>
<br/>

5. Let's now create a new bookmark.  Locate a time in the video to create a bookmark.  This can be done by playing the video and pausing at the desired location. Once you have a good idea where to place the bookmark, click on **New Bookmark** and then enter **Bookmark Name** and **Description**.  If necessary, adjust the **Start Time** to the desired time in the video.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/385-Video-NewBookmark.png)

<br/>

Please note - for demonstration purposes, the interview video contains title pages to each question so that it aligns very nicely with the bookmarks.  Try adding a new video yourself and create some video bookmarks.
