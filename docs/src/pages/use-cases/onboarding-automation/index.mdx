# Introduction

**Entry Point:** Enable secure, compliant content access with content services

**Use Case Overview:** Focus Corp must collaborate both internally and externally during the employee onboarding process as well as enforce structured and adhoc workflows. 

Focus Corp accelerates the use of unstructured content in an employee onboarding use case using teamspaces and secure external file sharing. You will assume the role of Lucy, an HR employee onboarding specialist at Focus Corp. Lucy’s objective is to improve Focus Corp’s process and ensure various onboarding requirements are met in a secure, structured, consistent and timely manner to onboard the new employees.


**Choose an option:**

  * **Digital Business Automation on Cloud trial:** your environment is predeployed, continue to the [Getting Started Lab](#getting-started-lab) section below.
  * **Install Yourself:** To deploy Onboarding Automation on your own environment, and technical architecture information, see the <a href="https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/dba-onboarding-auto.git" target="_blank">dba-onboarding-auto</a> git repository which includes the required deployment artifacts.

<summary>3 - Tour IBM Navigator</summary>

#### IBM Navigator is a desktop for an organization's workers to find and organize information.


<br/>

You are now a Human Resources (HR) Onboarding specialist (Lucy) at Focus Corp reviewing an applicant (John Doe) for employment. As an onboarding specialist, Lucy will use the IBM Navigator user interface to review content submitted by John such as the employment application and interview video.

<br/>

Let's take a quick tour of the **IBM Navigator** user interface.

<br/>
<br/>

Open the Onboarding Automation app which opens the **IBM Navigator** user interface

<br/>

At the top of the interface, we see a configurable banner with a hamburger icon to access Navigator Features such as **Browse**, **Search**, **Share**, **Teamspaces**, **Workflow** and **Records Management**.  Additional features can also be added using plugins.

<br/>

Select the **Browse** feature.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/100-Navigator-Browse.png)

<br/>

We are currently viewing a repository called **Corporate Operations** which is an **IBM FileNet Content Manager** repository. We can also access other repositories and perform cross-repository searches using **CM8**, **CMoD**, **Box** and **CMIS** (Content Management Interoperability Services) compliant repositories like **Alfresco** and **Microsoft SharePoint** On-Premises.

<br/>


 ![13](./images/110-Navigator-OnboardedEmployees.png)
<br/>

Select the **Focus Corp Docs - Human Resources – Onboarded Employees** folder representing content that we have for employees that have already been onboarded.  For onboarded employee – **Selena Swift**, we can see custom folder properties such as the **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Employee ID**, **Onboarding** status and **Hire Date**.

<br/>

In our example, Focus Corp maintains an **Employee Packet** folder that contains new employee info documents such as the **Confidentially Agreement** and **Employee Manual**.  In the **Details** view, we are able the thumbnail and properties of the selected content.
When we switch over to the **Magazine** view, we can now we see the same content along with social features such as **Likes**, **Tags**, **Downloads** and **Comments**.  We also have a **Filmstrip** view that’s very useful for looking at media such as these pictures in the **Photos** folder.

<summary>5 - View and Edit Documents</summary>

<br/>

As a Supervisor, you are now ready to create a new workstream and publish it so the departments you work with, such as Accounts Payable and HR, can submit their requests in an organized manner.

<br/>

1. Click the menu grid icon in the upper right corner and select **Create workstreams**

 ![13](./images/Slide18.png)

> NOTE: selecting **All users** will allow any user in the system to submit a new request to your team; this could also be restricted to a team that you create, if desired.

<br/>

4. Review the workstream editor:
    1. Your workflow will show vertically on the left.
    1. The currently selected activity in your workflow is configurable on the right.
    1. A draft can be saved at any time
    1. The Save button will place the workflow in trial mode for testers to try out.

> Note: if you do not see the task in the list, you can either click the magnifying glass and search for `skill` or click the browser refresh button.  The task list may not refresh automatically in some browsers so searching should be faster than a full refresh.

 ![13](./images/Slide29.png)

<br/>

    1. Check off the items in the checklist
    1. Fill in the data fields

# Full Demo Narration

#### Intro

Working in a remote environment adds complexity to most tasks.  Imagine you lead a shared services team and receive requests from other departments such as Accounts Payable or HR. In person, it's simple to collect information and share status.

However, in a remote environment, organizing work is more challenging.  Relying on email and phone is just not enough. Work can be duplicated or executed inconsistently, resulting in lost data and delays.  You need a lightweight workflow to manage incoming requests.

#### Demo Start Page

After reviewing the demo launch page including the outline and discovery map, we are ready to launch the Line of Business Supervisor's Workplace interface, the single place you manage all your work.

#### Manage workstream teams

You check out the start workflow list and see great starting activities and workflows such as approval, checklist and more.

You start by managing the teams.  It's a good idea to add yourself to at least Administrators and Supervisors and maybe Team managers.  You can also create a Shared Services team so you can assign work to them later.

#### Create a workstream

Now it's time to create a workstream for incoming shared services requests.  We'll set it so everyone can start and give a description.  The simple, no-code editor allows you to assemble a workflow in just a few clicks.  Start with a checklist activity to represent the skill profile requested.  To make this reusable, we add checklist items with placeholders and allow the user that launches the flow to update and add more.  Let's also add a couple data items for the country and date available.  Once the request is submitted, the shared services team member will complete this form and confirm their skills.  Your first activity is complete!

We add another step to get manager approval and setup a simple branch flow.  For the approval branch we add a form to notify of the result.  Then, head back to our approval and add the rejection branch.  So simple!  To complete the workstream, we save and we're ready to go.

#### Test a workstream

The new flow starts in trial mode for the author or a testing group to try it out safely before the end users.  Simple to test, we see the launch screen specific to this workstream where the user starting the flow, such as an Accounts Payable clerk, will configure available options including checklist items, and also any activity assignments allowed by the workstream, which we did not activate yet.

Once started, we go back to the main Workplace.  Let's take on the role of a shared services team member and see how easy it is to complete the first step. Claim and open the task, check the checklist items, fill in the data, optionally attach a document for review, type a comment and submit.  This is much easier and more organized than email.  Now taking on my team manager role for approval, all looks good and I accept.  Finally, the original requestor receives an approval notification to complete the request. Back at the task list we can switch to workflows and without any customization, the tool provides a complete audit trail of all work by default.

#### Publish a workstream

Once ready, I can request a publish to share my workstream with other teams.  The platform has a built-in approval workstream for workstreams!  So we head to the same task list, click to review the workstream definition.  As a publisher, I may send it back with comments or publish directly.  And in just a few minutes, I created, tested and published a new, lightweight workflow available to anyone in my organization: ready to launch!

#### Use Case Summary

As you saw, Workstream Services helps you manage remote work more effectively by allowing business users to create lightweight workflows that automate internal processes, no coding required. Get ready to improve your team's productivity by simplifying common tasks and decreasing the complexity and limitations of remote work.
