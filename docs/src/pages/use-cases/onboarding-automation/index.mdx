# Introduction

**Entry Point:** Enable secure, compliant content access with content services

**Use Case Overview:** Focus Corp must collaborate both internally and externally during the employee onboarding process as well as enforce structured and adhoc workflows. 

Focus Corp accelerates the use of unstructured content in an employee onboarding use case using teamspaces and secure external file sharing. You will assume the role of Lucy, an HR employee onboarding specialist at Focus Corp. Lucy’s objective is to improve Focus Corp’s process and ensure various onboarding requirements are met in a secure, structured, consistent and timely manner to onboard the new employees.


**Choose an option:**

  * **Digital Business Automation on Cloud trial:** your environment is predeployed, continue to the [Getting Started Lab](#getting-started-lab) section below.
  * **Install Yourself:** To deploy Onboarding Automation on your own environment, and technical architecture information, see the <a href="https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/dba-onboarding-auto.git" target="_blank">dba-onboarding-auto</a> git repository which includes the required deployment artifacts.

<summary>3 - Tour IBM Navigator</summary>

#### IBM Navigator is a desktop for an organization's workers to find and organize information.


<br/>

You are now a Human Resources (HR) Onboarding specialist (Lucy) at Focus Corp reviewing an applicant (John Doe) for employment. As an onboarding specialist, Lucy will use the IBM Navigator user interface to review content submitted by John such as the employment application and interview video.

<br/>

Let's take a quick tour of the **IBM Navigator** user interface.

<br/>

1. Open the **Onboarding Automation** app to open the **IBM Navigator** user interface

<br/>

 ![13](./images/020-Onboarding_Auto_app.png)

<br/>

At the top of the interface, we see a configurable banner with a hamburger icon to access the **Navigation Menu** to access **Features** such as **Browse**, **Search**, **Share**, **Teamspaces**, **Workflow** and **Records Management**.  Additional features can also be added using plugins.

<br/>

2. Select the **Browse** feature.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/100-Navigator-Browse2.png)

<br/>

We are currently viewing a repository called **Corporate Operations** which is an **IBM FileNet Content Manager** repository. We can also access other repositories and perform cross-repository searches using **CM8**, **CMoD**, **Box** and **CMIS** (Content Management Interoperability Services) compliant repositories like **Alfresco** and **Microsoft SharePoint** On-Premises.

<br/>

3. Select the **Focus Corp Docs - Human Resources – Onboarded Employees** folder representing content that we have for employees that have already been onboarded.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/110-Navigator-OnboardedEmployees.png)

<br/>


For onboarded employee – **Selena Swift**, we can see custom folder properties such as the **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Employee ID**, **Onboarding** status and **Hire Date**.

<br/>

4. Select the **Employee Packet** folder and then in the upper-right corner, select the different **Views** (**Details**, **Magazine**, **Filmstrip**).

<br/>

 ![13](./images/120-Navigator-EmployeePacket.png)

<br/>

In our example, Focus Corp maintains an **Employee Packet** folder that contains new employee info documents such as the **Confidentially Agreement** and **Employee Manual**.  In the **Details** view, we are able the thumbnail and properties of the selected content.
When we switch over to the **Magazine** view, we can now we see the same content along with social features such as **Likes**, **Tags**, **Downloads** and **Comments**.  We also have a **Filmstrip** view that’s very useful for looking at media such as these pictures in the **Photos** folder.

<br/>

[Go to top](#introduction) | [Go to Getting Started Lab](#getting-started-lab)
</details>

<details>
<summary>4 - Review Teamspaces</summary>

<br/>

#### Let’s now look at Teamspaces.  Teamspaces represent a focused view of the relevant folders, documents and searches that a team needs to complete their tasks.

<br/>

1. From the **Navigation Menu**, select **Teamspaces**

<br/>

 ![13](./images/200-Teamspace-Feature.png)

<br/>

A list of Teamspaces should be displayed. In the diagram below, we have selected the **Employee Onboarding - John Doe** Teamspace.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/210-Teamspaces.png)
> Note: Please use the Teamspace that was created in section **2 - Login and Setup Your Environment**.

<br/>

2. Select your Teamspace and right-click to select **Modify**, **Roles**.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/220-Teamspace-Roles.png)

<br/>

A Teamspace can be configured with custom roles with granular security permissions.  Clicking on a role allows you to view and manage the security permissions of the role.  In the diagram below, the **HR - Human Resources** custom role and associated permission is shown.  The **Team** tab can also be selected to view and manage users/groups assigned to the role.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/230-Teamspace-Roles-Security.png)

<br/>

>Note: This lab covers the usage of a Teamspace, please refer to the **Teamspaces** asset in the **Additional Assets** section for information on the setup of **Teamspace Templates** and the general configuration of a Teamspace.  The use of **Teamspace Templates** allows for the configuration of the folder hierarchy, documents, search templates, and security in a user-friendly wizard interface which can then be used to create Teamspaces in a timely, secure and consistent manner.

<br/>

3. Click **Cancel** to exit the **Modify Teamspace** screen and click on your Teamspace to view the Teamspace.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/240-Teamspace-View.png)

<br/>

This is the Teamspace - note the three sections on the left-hand side of the screen for **Browse** to manage content, **Search** to manage search templates, **Team** to view members of the Teamspace.

<br/>

The middle/main section of the screen displays the content selected in the **Browse** and **Search** section. As shown in the diagram above, the **Application** folder is selected in the **Browse** section with the contents of the folder displayed in the main section.  Additionally, the employment application document is selected the main section and the **Properties** section of the screen shows the custom document properties associated with the document (**First Name**, **Last Name**, **Application Date**) along with the document **System Properties**.

<br/>

Note the folder structure in the **Browse** section, this and the associated documents were automatically created using the **Teamspace Template**.

<br/>

[Go to top](#introduction) | [Go to Getting Started Lab](#getting-started-lab)

</details>

<details>
<summary>5 - View and Edit Documents</summary>

<br/>

Continuing from the previous Teamspace step, let's now review how to view and edit documents.
> Note: Use the **application document** that was added to the Teamspace in section **2 - Login and Setup Your Environment**.  This document represents the employee applicant's employement application and also contains an I9 document which will we remove and create using the **Merge and Split** option.

1. From the **Teamspace**, click on the employment application document

 ![13](./images/300-Viewer-Overview.png)

<br/>

Review the different areas of the viewer using the **Demo Video** as a reference.  Additionally, hover the mouse over tool to reveal the tool tip.

<br/>

2.  From **View Settings**, click on the **Fit to window** icon to fit a full page of the document in the display

 ![13](./images/310-Viewer-Fit.png)

<br/>

As displayed in the diagram above, the page should now fit in the display window.  We can now see the full page of the document including all the redactions and annotations on the first page.

<br/>

3. For each redaction and annotation, hover the mouse over the item to see who created the item and the creation timestamp.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/315-Viewer-Timestamp.png)

<br/>


4. Right-click on a redaction then select the first menu option which is **Select Redaction Reason**

<br/>

 ![13](./images/320-Viewer-Redaction-Reason.png)

<br/>

As displayed in the diagram above, the reason for the redaction is displayed and can also be set to a different reason if desired.  Redaction Reasons use role-based security so that only users within a configured role can see behind the redaction and/or manage the redaction. Additionally, the **IBM Datcap** capture solution can be configured to automatically redact values such as a Social Security Number and associate with the redaction reason.

<br/>

Click **Cancel** to exit out of the **Select Redaction Reason** dialog window.

<br/>

5. Either double-click on the yellow sticky note -OR- right-click on the sticky note and then click on the second menu option for **Edit text**

<br/>

 ![13](./images/330-Sticky-Note.png)

<br/>

As displayed in the diagram above, the text for the **Sticky note** annotation is displayed along with the creation/modified timestamp. With appropriate security, we are also able to modify the text.  The **Sticky note** in the annotation toolbar is also identified in the diagram if you want to create a new **Sticky note** annotation.

<br/>

To the right of the **Sticky note** annotation on the application document, there is also a **Text** annotation to display text without having to open the annotation.

<br/>

6. In the upper-right corner of the viewer, click on the **View Comments** icon

<br/>

 ![13](./images/340-Doc-Comment.png)

<br/>

As displayed in the diagram above, any existing document comments are displayed here.  The **Filter** box can be used to search for a specific comment.  A new comment can be added by entering text at the bottom of the viewer and then pressing the **Enter** button. If the user has appropriate security, existing comments can be edited or deleted by right-clicking on a comment and then clicking on the **Edit** or **Delete** option as shown in the diagram above.

<br/>

Additionally, **Document Comments** can be added directly from the document by right-clicking on the document and then selecting the **Properties** menu option.

<br/>

When complete, click on the **View Comments** icon at the top of the viewer to toggle out of the **View Comments** mode.

<br/>

7. After exiting the **View Comments** mode, review the existing **Stamp** annotations and enter a new **Stamp** annotation by clicking on the **Stamp** annotation in the **Annotations** bar area on the right side of the viewer. Next, click on the **Approved** option and then click where you want the annotation to be located on the document.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/350-Stamp.png)

<br/>

As displayed in the diagram above, the existing stamp annotations that are shown magnified.  These stamp annotations represent when the document was recieved and reviewed.  After clicking on the **Approved** stamp annotation, the **Stamp** annotation should now appear on the document with your email address along with the date.

<br/>

When complete, click on the **Save** icon to save the annotation.

<br/>

8. Let's now view the thumbnails of the document by clicking on the **Thumbnails view** from the bottom of the viewer.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/360-Thumbnail.png)

<br/>

As displayed in the diagram above, the thumbnails of each page of the document is displayed.


Please note that the size of the thumbnail can be increased/decreased by clicking on the magnifying glass +/- icons located at the bottom of the viewer as shown below.  

<br/>

# Full Demo Narration

#### Intro

Working in a remote environment adds complexity to most tasks.  Imagine you lead a shared services team and receive requests from other departments such as Accounts Payable or HR. In person, it's simple to collect information and share status.

However, in a remote environment, organizing work is more challenging.  Relying on email and phone is just not enough. Work can be duplicated or executed inconsistently, resulting in lost data and delays.  You need a lightweight workflow to manage incoming requests.

#### Demo Start Page

After reviewing the demo launch page including the outline and discovery map, we are ready to launch the Line of Business Supervisor's Workplace interface, the single place you manage all your work.

#### Manage workstream teams

You check out the start workflow list and see great starting activities and workflows such as approval, checklist and more.

You start by managing the teams.  It's a good idea to add yourself to at least Administrators and Supervisors and maybe Team managers.  You can also create a Shared Services team so you can assign work to them later.

#### Create a workstream

Now it's time to create a workstream for incoming shared services requests.  We'll set it so everyone can start and give a description.  The simple, no-code editor allows you to assemble a workflow in just a few clicks.  Start with a checklist activity to represent the skill profile requested.  To make this reusable, we add checklist items with placeholders and allow the user that launches the flow to update and add more.  Let's also add a couple data items for the country and date available.  Once the request is submitted, the shared services team member will complete this form and confirm their skills.  Your first activity is complete!

We add another step to get manager approval and setup a simple branch flow.  For the approval branch we add a form to notify of the result.  Then, head back to our approval and add the rejection branch.  So simple!  To complete the workstream, we save and we're ready to go.

#### Test a workstream

The new flow starts in trial mode for the author or a testing group to try it out safely before the end users.  Simple to test, we see the launch screen specific to this workstream where the user starting the flow, such as an Accounts Payable clerk, will configure available options including checklist items, and also any activity assignments allowed by the workstream, which we did not activate yet.

Once started, we go back to the main Workplace.  Let's take on the role of a shared services team member and see how easy it is to complete the first step. Claim and open the task, check the checklist items, fill in the data, optionally attach a document for review, type a comment and submit.  This is much easier and more organized than email.  Now taking on my team manager role for approval, all looks good and I accept.  Finally, the original requestor receives an approval notification to complete the request. Back at the task list we can switch to workflows and without any customization, the tool provides a complete audit trail of all work by default.

#### Publish a workstream

Once ready, I can request a publish to share my workstream with other teams.  The platform has a built-in approval workstream for workstreams!  So we head to the same task list, click to review the workstream definition.  As a publisher, I may send it back with comments or publish directly.  And in just a few minutes, I created, tested and published a new, lightweight workflow available to anyone in my organization: ready to launch!

#### Use Case Summary

As you saw, Workstream Services helps you manage remote work more effectively by allowing business users to create lightweight workflows that automate internal processes, no coding required. Get ready to improve your team's productivity by simplifying common tasks and decreasing the complexity and limitations of remote work.
