# Introduction

**Use Case Overview:** Imagine that a customer purchases your product, but is unfortunately unsatisfied and requests a refund. Today, your refund process has several manual steps. Managing high volumes of refunds that require manual investigation leads to slow average completion times, inconsistent status updates to customers, and higher costs for any errors made.
This use case demonstrates the use of automation in the form of straight-through-processing to save time, money, and customer frustration.

**Choose an option:**

  * **Cloud Pak for Business Automation as a Service demo environment (likely an IBMer):** your environment is predeployed, continue to the [Getting Started Lab](#getting-started-lab) section below.
  * **Install Yourself:** To deploy Refund Request on your own environment, and technical architecture information, see the <a href="https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/dba-refund-request.git" target="_blank">dba-refund-request</a> git repository which includes the required deployment artifacts.

<summary>4 - (Optional) Complete the investigation task</summary>

<br/>
You are now a Focus Corp employee, first an Refund Investigator and later an Operations Specialist and Rule Manager.

<br/>
<br/>

Refund Invesigators are busy people as they not only process refunds that cannot be automatically approved or denied, but they also look into trends and perform data analysis across the Focus Corp organization.  When they need to take time out from their high priority work to perform a refund request, they are not too happy.  Luckily, Cloud Pak for Business Automation provides them all the information they need in one place and streamlines the investigation process.

<br/>

 ![13](./images/replace.png)

<br/>

1. Click **Return to launchpad**
2. Click the picture of the **Refund Investigator**
3. Choose your preferred interface, if prompted
4. Review the list of tasks and click on the most recent Investigation task to claim and complete it

> Note the data is passed from the application to the process which then retrieved additional information and routed the work to the appropriate Refund Investigator

6. Complete the task by approving or denying the refund

# Full Demo Narration

#### Focus Corp Demos Dashboard

Reviewing the Focus Corp Demos Dashboard we see a text summary describing the demo, a discovery map diagram and a flow diagram for our reference.  OK, let's launch the demo...

#### Customer refund requests

We start by becoming the customer.  From the Focus Corp Your Returns and Refunds portal, we select one of our recent orders and submit a return.  The result is approved with an expected date to receive funds.

We select and submit another order for refund but before we submit, let's take a peak behind the form at some of the business rules.  A few of the fields are used by a set of business rules to make the refund decision and we see those here.  This refund request results in a denial but it is still straight through processing without any manual work.

Upon selecting a final, third order, the rules this time are not certain and send the refund request off to a human queue for manual investigation.  This bottom investigation branch of the straight through process can utilize significant resources.

#### Operations week 1

A few manual refunds are not a problem for the team, but too many will cause delays and our customer satisfaction will go down.  The Operations Specialist reviews the Refund Dashboard, powered by Business Automation Insights and see not only the percentage of manually processed requests is high at more than 67% but the average manual investigation time across all requests is more than 2 hours.  They pass their findings to the Rule Manager to take action.

#### Rules manager

As a rules manager, we have access to the decision model behind our refund process. The data is passed from the process system to the rules in the form of an order and refund request.  This moves through various decision tables including a time window validation that deals with the return reason, the days since delivery and the condition of the goods.  In combination, these lead to various processing decisions and we see a few that result in manual processing listed.  Another decision table deals with the type of goods and may also result in some manual processing.  Finally, this is then combined with a simple text rule to make the final decision.

The rules manager drafted up a new branch of the decision model with some updates, let's take a look.  To reduce manual processing, the rules manager adjusted the tables to remove some of the manual processing decisions.  Comparing the two versions shows that row 3 column 3 moved from manual to denied, for example.  Other rows were removed which results in an default approved decision.  We could also test and simulate the rule changes and compare historical results but we won't cover that here in this demo.

#### Customer manual to approved

After the Rules Manager deploys the new rules, let go back to being a customer and try them out.  Submitting the same order as before which resulted in a manual result now is approved!

#### Operations week 2

After these new rules are in place for a week, the Operations Specialist sees some solid improvement with a reduction in half for manual requests and also lower manual processing time average from above 120, down to only 60 mins.

#### Use Case Summary

With combined workflow and decision automation, both capabilities within IBM Cloud Pak for Automation, and updated business rules, we reduce the manual processing queues significantly

Increased straight through processing results in lower average completion time, lower costs, and more consistent communication with the customer throughout the process.  Now our processors can truly increase customer satisfaction.
