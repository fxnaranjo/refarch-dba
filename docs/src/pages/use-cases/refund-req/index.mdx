## Scenario Overview

Imagine that a customer purchases your product, but is unfortunately unsatisfied and requests a refund. Today, your refund process has several manual steps. Managing high volumes of refunds that require manual investigation leads to slow average completion times, inconsistent status updates to customers, and higher costs for any errors made. Although you have guidelines that determine when a refund is approved or denied, there are still inconsistencies in the decision-making. This use case demonstrates the use of automation in the form of straight-through-processing to save time, money, and customer frustration.


## Preparation and Deployment

The [dba-refund-request](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/dba-refund-request.git) git repository includes the artifacts needed for this lab.

### Environment

We assume the following products are installed, up and running:

- IBM Cloud PakÂ® for Automation version 20.0.2
    - Business Automation Workflow (BAW) on VMs
    - Operational Decision Manager (ODM) on OpenShift
    - Business Automation Insights (BAI) on OpenShift (Optional, can be run without)

### Deploy the artifacts

1. Determine your credentials
    1. For BAW, use your own credentials to login to Workflow Center and Process Portal
    1. For ODM, create a service credential/account or use your own basic auth credentials to login to Rule Execution Server console
    1. For BAI, set your password as required by your platform and login to Kibana
1. Deploy ODM artifacts
    1. Login to Decision Center Business console
    1. On Library, click the import icon
    1. Import `Refund Processing [main].zip`
    1. Open the main branch, click Deployments and deploy to your Rule Execution Server (adjust the server within the deployment configuration as required)
    1. Return to the branch list and click the plus sign to create a new branch based on main named Reduce Manual Processing
    1. Import `Refund Processing [Reduce Manual Processing].zip` to the new branch and choose to replace the existing elements
    1. Deploy the new branch as a second version
1. (Optional) Deploy BAI artifacts
    1. Login to Kibana
    1. Management -> Saved Objects -> Import -> `RefundRequest YYYY.MM.DD_XX.json`
1. Deploy BAW artifacts
    1. Login to Workflow Center and navigate to Process Apps
    1. Import `Refund_Request - YYYY.MM.DD_XX.twx`
    1. Open the Refund Request process app and navigate to Process App Settings -> Servers
    1. Edit the settings for hostname, port, authentication and so forth for your ODM server
    1. (Optional) Open the BAI Generators team and add an appropriate user to the team
    1. Go back to Workflow Center and create a new snapshot of the process application
    1. Install the new snapshot to your Workflow Server unless you wish to run directly on Workflow Center's playback server (to support the optional BAI events, make sure the BAW server running the process app has BAI emitters enabled)
1. (Optional) Setup BAI data
    1. Login to Process Portal with the user specified in the above BAI Generators team
    1. Under Launch, click Generate Week 1 BAI Data RR and wait for the spinner to complete in about 20 seconds
    1. Do the same for Generate Week 2 BAI Data RR
    1. Login to Kibana
    1. Management -> Index Patterns -> process-sum* -> refresh icon
    1. To improve the dashboard, edit the` `data.TG.pTime.integer` field and set the Format to `Number` and the Numeral.js format pattern to `0,0` and save
    1. Open the Dashboard -> Refund Request (RR) - Week 1 and Week 2 and check that data is displayed.  If it is not, check your emitters are sending data and connected to the BAW server where the Process App is deployed.

**Business Challenge:** Customer demand is volatile ... requiring the ability to quickly scale up or down
As the Focus Corp Demo Dashboard is currently embedded within the process app and deployed to the Process Portal, it is recommended that you make this your default dashboard.

**Entry Point:** Handle spikes in demand with straight-through processing

**Use Case Overview:** Imagine that a customer purchases your product, but is unfortunately unsatisfied and requests a refund. Today, your refund process has several manual steps. Managing high volumes of refunds that require manual investigation leads to slow average completion times, inconsistent status updates to customers, and higher costs for any errors made.
This use case demonstrates the use of automation in the form of straight-through-processing to save time, money, and customer frustration.

**Choose an option:**

  * **Digital Business Automation on Cloud trial:** your environment is predeployed, continue to the [Guided Tour](#use-case-guided-tour) section below.
  * **Install Yourself:** To deploy Refund Request on your own environment, and technical architecture information, see the <a href="https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/dba-refund-request.git" target="_blank">dba-refund-request</a> git repository which includes the required deployment artifacts.

### Demo Narration and Flow

#### Corp Demos Dashboard

Reviewing the `Focus Corp Demos Dashboard` we see a text summary describing the demo, a discovery map diagram and a flow diagram for our reference.  OK, let's launch the demo...

#### Customer refund requests

We start by becoming the customer.  From the Focus Corp Your Returns and Refunds portal, we select one of our recent orders and submit a return.  The result is approved with an expected date to receive funds.

We select and submit another order for refund but before we submit, let's take a peak behind the form at some of the business rules.  A few of the fields are used by a set of business rules to make the refund decision and we see those here.  This refund request results in a denial but it is still straight through processing without any manual work.

Upon selecting a final, third order, the rules this time are not certain and send the refund request off to a human queue for manual investigation.  This bottom investigation branch of the straight through process can utilize significant resources.

#### Operations week 1

A few manual refunds are not a problem for the team, but too many will cause delays and our customer satisfaction will go down.  The Operations Specialist reviews the Refund Dashboard, powered by Business Automation Insights and see not only the percentage of manually processed requests is high at more than 67% but the average manual investigation time across all requests is more than 2 hours.  They pass their findings to the Rule Manager to take action.

#### Rules manager

As a rules manager, we have access to the decision model behind our refund process. The data is passed from the process system to the rules in the form of an order and refund request.  This moves through various decision tables including a time window validation that deals with the return reason, the days since delivery and the condition of the goods.  In combination, these lead to various processing decisions and we see a few that result in manual processing listed.  Another decision table deals with the type of goods and may also result in some manual processing.  Finally, this is then combined with a simple text rule to make the final decision.

The rules manager drafted up a new branch of the decision model with some updates, let's take a look.  To reduce manual processing, the rules manager adjusted the tables to remove some of the manual processing decisions.  Comparing the two versions shows that row 3 column 3 moved from manual to denied, for example.  Other rows were removed which results in an default approved decision.  We could also test and simulate the rule changes and compare historical results but we won't cover that here in this demo.

#### Customer manual to approved

After the Rules Manager deploys the new rules, let go back to being a customer and try them out.  Submitting the same order as before which resulted in a manual result now is approved!

#### Operations week 2

After these new rules are in place for a week, the Operations Specialist sees some solid improvement with a reduction in half for manual requests and also lower manual processing time average from above 120, down to only 60 mins.

#### Use Case Summary

With combined workflow and decision automation, both capabilities within IBM Cloud Pak for Automation, and updated business rules, we reduce the manual processing queues significantly

Increased straight through processing results in lower average completion time, lower costs, and more consistent communication with the customer throughout the process.  Now our processors can truly increase customer satisfaction.
